    "- Review, reflect on, and apply different strategies for multidimensional/multivariate/temporal datasets\n",

    "## Bob Ross\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's assignment will have you working with artwork created by [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross). Bob was a very famous painter who had a televised painting show from 1983 to 1994. Over 13 seasons and approximately 400 paintings, Bob would walk the audience through a painting project. Often these were landscape images. Bob was famous for telling his audience to paint \"happy trees\" and sayings like, \"We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.\" His soothing voice and bushy hair are well known to many generations of viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never seen an episode, I might suggest starting with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw6odlNp7_8). \n",
    "\n",
    "![bob ross](assets/bobrosspaints.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob Ross left a long legacy of art which makes for an interesting dataset to analyze. It's both temporally rich and has a lot of variables we can code. We'll be starting with the dataset created by 538 for their article on a [Statistical Analysis of Bob Ross](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/). The authors of the article coded each painting to indicate what features the image contained (e.g., one tree, more than one tree, what kinds of clouds, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we've downloaded a second dataset that contains the actual images. We know what kind of paint colors Bob used in each episode, and we have used that to create a dataset for you containing the color distributions. For example, we approximate how much '<font color='#614f4b'>burnt umber</font>' he used by measuring the distance (in color space) from each pixel in the image to the color. This is imperfect, of course (paints don't mix this way), but it'll be close enough for our analysis."

    "\n",
    "The 538 article ([Statistical Analysis of Bob Ross](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/)) has a long analysis of conditional probabilities. Essentially, we want to know the probability of one feature given another (e.g., what is the probability of Snow given Trees?). The article calculates this over the entire history of the show, but we would like to visualize these probabilities over time. Have they been constant? or evolving?  We will only be doing this for a few variables (otherwise, we'll have a matrix of over 3000 small charts). Specifically, we care about images that contain: 'At least one tree','At least two trees','Clouds','Grass','At least one mountain','Lake.' Each small multiple plot will be a line chart corresponding to the conditional probability over time. The matrix \"cell\" indicates which pairs of variables are being considered (e.g., probability of at least two trees given the probability of at least one tree is the 2nd row, first column in our example).\n",

    "The full image is [available here](assets/matrix_full.png). While your small multiples visualization should contain all this data, you can ***feel free to style it as you think is appropriate***. We will be grading (minimally) on aesthetics. Implement the code for the function: ```makeBobRossCondProb()``` to return this chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on doing this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you don't remember how to calculate conditional probabilities, take a look at the article. Remember, we want the conditional probabilities given the images in a specific year. This is simply an implementation of Bayes' Theorem. We implemented a function called ```condprobability(...)``` as you can see below. You can do the same or pick your own strategy for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We suggest creating a long-form representation of the table for this data. For example, here's a sample of ours (you can use this to double this sample for your calculations):\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"Long form conditional probabilities](assets/cond_prob_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a number of strategies to build the small-multiple plots. Some are easier than others. You will find in this case that some combinations of repeated charts and faceting will not work. However, you should be able to use the standard concatenation approaches in combination with repeated charts or faceting."

    "Your last problem is fairly open-ended in terms of visualization. We would like to analyze the colors used in different images for a given season as a small multiples plot. You can pick how you represent your small multiples, but we will ask you to defend your choices below.  You must implement the function ```colorSmallMultiples(season)``` that takes a season number as input (e.g., 2) and returns an Altair chart. \n",

    "![\"simple small multiples\"](assets/bob_ross_color_glyph.png)\n",

    "This visualization has a row for every painting and a colored circle (in the color of the paint). The circle is sized based on the amount of the corresponding paint that is used in the image. \n",

    "![\"face small multiples\"](assets/bob_ross_face.png)\n",

    "Here, we've overlaid circles as curls in Bob's massive hair. We're not claiming this is an effective solution, but you're welcome to do this (or anything else) as long as you describe the pros and cons of your choices. And, yes, we generated both examples using Altair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the relevant columns are available are listed in ```rosspaints``` (there are 18 of them). The values range from 0 to 1 based on the fraction of pixel color allocated to that specific paint.  The ```rosspainthex``` has the corresponding hex values for the paint color. \n"

    "As I was deciding upon what mark encoding to use for this problem, I was torn between utilizing a stacked bar chart through mark_bar(), segmenting each painting into its own bar, and divvying up that bar by color based on the percentage of that color utilized in each respective painting, while also encoding each chunk as its respective color, and the more visually simplistic circle charts shown above. Ultimately, I decided to run with the latter approach, primarily because I wanted to choose a visualization technique that prioritized interpretability, minimized the data-ink ratio, and minimized excess chart junk. I would argue that this approach is acceptably expressive, as all of the necessary data - the amount of each color in each painting for that season, encoded by the size of the circles - is present, and all unnecessary data is absent. In regards to effectiveness, I believe that would depend on the particular aims of the viewer. If the viewer was interested in seeing the percentage of each color utilized for each painting, there wouldn't have been a very intuitive way of accomplishing that with this approach. Furthermore, if the viewer was interested in doing cross-color comparison - how much of one color is present in one painting vs another painting - it is almost unfeasible to do so with this approach. This is where a stacked bar chart would have been more advantageous, as the viewer would have been able to draw their eye across each bar with ease to compare the amount of color used within each painting. Where this approach is most effective, I believe, is for a high-level single color analysis(how much an individual color is utilized across an entire season's paintings), as well as for the detection of extreme outliers(individual paintings containing 0.0% of a certain color, or an individual painting having a drastically larger or smaller amount of color used as compared to others)."
